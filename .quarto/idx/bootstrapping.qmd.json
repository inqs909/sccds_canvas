Therefore, if we were to resample $\\{x_i\\}^n_{i=1}$, with replacement, it is equivalent to sampling from $\\hat F_n$. \n\n## The Bootstrap Method\n\nThe Bootstrap Method is commonly used to obtain the standard error and or confidence limits of an estimator. By repeatedly sampling from $\\hat F_n$, the sampling distribution of any estimator can be approximated. This is advantageous from standard mathematical models which imposes a distribution on $F$, which may be completely inaccurate. The only assumption being made is that $\\hat F_n$ is close the true distribution function $F$.  \n\n### Algorithm\n\nLet $\\boldsymbol X = (X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n)$ be a random sample from a distribution $F$. For an estimator $T(\\cdot)$: \n\n1.  Draw a sample $\\boldsymbol X^*_b$ of size $n$, with replacement, from the original data $\\boldsymbol X$.\n2.  Compute the bootstrap replicate statistic $T*_b = T(\\boldsymbol X^*_b)$, where $T(\\cdot)$ is the function that computes the statistic of interest.\n3.  Repeat steps 1-2 $B$ times to obtain $B$ bootstrap replicates $T^*{T*_1, T*_2, ..., T*_B}$.\n\n\nThe computed statistics from $B$ samples are the empirical bootstrap distribution of the estimator, $T(\\boldsymbol X)$. This can be used to compute the standard error, bias, and confidence interval of the estimator $T(\\boldsymbol X)$. The number or replicates needed is open to discussion; however, research has shown $B=200$ to suffiece. Larger $B$ may be needed for confidence limit estimation. Another rule of thumb is having $B=n$; however, this may be unfeasible for extremely large samples or computationally intensive tasks.\n\n### Standard Error Estimation\n\nThe bootstrap-based standard error of an estimator is shown to provide an unbiased estimate of the true standard error. We can compute the standard eror using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\hat{se}\\left\\{T(\\boldsymbol X)\\right\\} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{B-1}\\sum^B_{i=1}(T^*_i-\\bar T^*)^2}\n$$\nwhere $\\bar T^* = \\frac{1}{B}\\sum^B_{i=1}T^*_i$.\n\n\n### Bias Estimation\n\nThe bootstrap-based bias estimate can be computed by the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\widehat{bias}\\left\\{T(\\boldsymbol X)\\right\\} = \\bar T^* -  T(X)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar T^* = \\frac{1}{B}\\sum^B_{i=1}T^*_i$ is the mean estimate of the bootstrap samples and $T(X)$ is computed statistic from the data.\n\n### Confidence Limits Estimation\n\nThe confidence limits of a parameter can be estimated by using the percentiles of the bootstrap replicates. The $(1-\\alpha) 100 \\%$ bootstrap confidence interval can be represented as:\n\n$$\n(T^*_{\\alpha/2},\\ T^*_{1-\\alpha/2})\n$$\nwhere $T^*_{\\alpha/2}$ with $\\alpha/2$ quantile and $T^*_{1-\\alpha/2}$ quantile of the bootstrap replicates.\n\n\n### Limitation to Boostrap Methods\n\nLet's say we randomly sample 5 data points from a Poisson Distribution with a rate of 5^[Note: The `set.seed` function ensures that the same random sample will be generated.]:\n\n```{r}\nset.seed(42)\nx <- rpois(5, 1.5)\nx\n```\n\nIf we were to use this sample and generate bootstrap estimates, we will obtain inaccurate results. This is because the empirical distribution function is a poor estimate of the true distribution function. One reason being that the $P(X = 0) = 0.2231$, and our sample does not have any 0 values. Any bootstrap samples produced will never carry that information. This is why a large sample is needed so the sample space can be thoroughly explored.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe examples below illustrate how to compute the bootstrap standard errors and confidence limits in a regression setting.\n\n### Linear Regression\n\nThe `mtcars` data set contains information on cars from 1974 *Motor Trend* US Magazine. Fitting a linear regression model between the variable `mpg` and `wt`:\n\n```{r}\nlm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars) |> summary()\nlm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars) |> confint()\n```\nWe can see that the estimated model between the 2 variables is $\\widehat{mpg} = 37.285 - 5.345 wt$. The standard error, based on the normal distribution, for the coefficient of `wt` is 0.5591. The 95% confidence interval for the coefficient of `wt` is (-6.486, -4.203)^[Note: The residual analysis may suggest that the linear regression model is not appropriate.].\n\nTo obtain the bootstrap-based standard error and 95% confidence interval, we will need to sample data points in the data set, with replacement. The user created function below will sample data points with replacement^[Note: You will need to have the `dplyr` function installed.]:\n\n```{r}\nresample <- function(df){\n  dplyr::slice_sample(df, n = nrow(df), replace = T )\n}\n```\n\nUsing the `resample`, we can get a bootstrap sample:\n\n\n```{r}\nb1 <- resample(mtcars)\nb1\n```\n\nNotice that some data points are repeated. We will then construct 10,000 bootstrap samples:\n\n```{r}\nboots <- lapply(1:10000, \\(x) resample(mtcars))\n```\n\nThe object `boots` is a list, with each element contain a boot replicate data set. Now we will, apply the `lm` function for each data set in `boots`.\n\n```{r}\nboots_lm <- lapply(boots, \\(x) lm(mpg ~ wt, x))\n```\n\nLastly, we will extract the coefficient value for each replicate^[We will unlist the object to utilize a vector]:\n\n```{r}\nboots_wt <- lapply(boots_lm, \\(x) coef(x)[\"wt\"]) |> unlist()\n```\n\nLet's visualize the distribution for the coefficient of `wt`:\n\n```{r}\ndata.frame(x = boots_wt) |> \n  ggplot(aes(x)) +\n  geom_density()\n```\n\nThe plot indicate that the coefficient for `wt` may not be symmetrical. The standard error can be obtained by applying the `sd` function to `boots_wt`:\n\n```{r}\nsd(boots_wt)\n```\n\nThe bootstrap-based standard error is 0.71. This is different from the normal-based standard error of 0.55. The 95% confidence interval of the coefficient of `wt` cna be obtained by using the `quantile` function and setting `probs = c(0.025, 0.975)`:\n\n```{r}\nquantile(boots_wt, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))\n```\n\nThe bootstrap-based 95% confidence interval is (-6.973, -4.164), which is slightly narrower than the mathematical-based 95% confidence interval: (-6.486, -4.203).","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThe Boostrap Method is an approach that can construct the sampling distribution of several estimators, not all estimators, without imposing a mathematical model on the data.
